</div>
<div id="id2">Zhongli is a calm, reserved, and polite man, who holds an air of nostalgia. Whereas he is said to have a stoic demeanor for duty, Zhongli also has a sentimental side He knows much about Liyue history and culture in part due to his time as the Geo Archon; like Venti, he has many experiences and memories, as he was a god well before The Seven even existed and one of the oldest still living in Teyvat. He holds philosophical ideas towards money and has great respect for Liyue's traditions, including those that have been forgotten or warped over time. Zhongli tends to be humble, being worried he comes off as a "bourgeois parasite."
Zhongli tends to forget about Mora in transactions, agreeing to spend large sums of it without having any Mora on hand and even taking "discounts" as granted despite being an obvious scam. He often ends up relying on his acquaintances for financial support, such as the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor or Childe. Although he works for Hu Tao, he does not like her childish behavior.

<div id="id3">
Alhaitham is a scholar who is fueled by a desire to understand the underlying principles of the world around him.He greatly values the pursuit of knowledge and dislikes meaningless noise and matters that distract or divert him from his chosen pursuits. To this end, while he is unambitious and enjoys leisure, he will do what he deems necessary to maintain a comfortable life.[2] Similarly, he dislikes holding positions of authority, even turning down the position of Grand Sage and resigning from the position of Acting Grand Sage as soon as he can.[2][3]

Alhaitham focuses greatly on himself at all times. However, he does not do so out of a disregard for others; instead, it is a result of his rationality. For example, he believes that as it is impossible to save everyone, it is important to focus on one's own well being first.Contrary to what his peers think, Alhaitham does not look down upon anyone and tends to give equal weight to everyone,[5] be they human or god.[6] He also places great importance in the value of humanity and has astute insight into human nature.[3] While he does not keep this a secret, he rarely bothers to correct others' unfavorable assumptions unless it would prove more troublesome to allow them to persist..<br>

<h2>AYATO</h2></div>

<div class="ayato">

</div>


<div id="id1">Ayato is a person that does not like to show his face in public often, preferring to work on his duties as the Yashiro Commissioner. A well-known fact about him is that he's extremely busy and stressed, as he has to deal with corrupt government officials while juggling his duty as the leader of the Shuumatsuban. Due to his duties, he loathes small talk, wanting people to get to the point. He uses a large array of methods to deal with corrupt officials, usually within legal bounds.

While he is not particularly well known due to his preference to remain behind the scenes, those who are familiar with him note that he is incredibly kind and has inspired loyalty from many people. For example, Hirotatsu states that he continues to serve the Yashiro Commission to repay the generosity that he showed him and his master and it is strongly implied that Ayato was the one who inspired Thoma to the point the latter received a Vision. Ayato has stated that he highly values loyalty and obedience (hence his preference for dogs), as strongly implied that there were numerous assassinations against him in the past, hence why he values those two traits so much to protect himself from rival clans and organizations.</div>
